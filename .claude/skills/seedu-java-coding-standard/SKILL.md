description: The Java coding standard this project follows — the se-edu Java conventions at the intermediate level. Use before writing or editing any .java file, after editing one, and whenever asked to check the coding standard, the Java conventions, the naming rules, the layout rules, or the Javadoc rules. Covers every .java file in the project, tests included.

# seedu-java-coding-standard

Every `.java` file in this project follows the
[se-edu Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html)
at the **intermediate** level. That includes the tests under `src/test/java`, not
just the code under `src/main/java`.

The rules are written out in [rules.md](rules.md), so you can apply them while
writing rather than only catching them afterwards. **The page at the URL above
outranks that file.** Fetch it whenever a rule is contested, whenever a finding
would change code, and whenever `rules.md` is silent on the question in front of
you. If the fetch fails and the answer matters, say the check could not be
settled rather than guessing.

## When to use this

* **Before writing Java.** Read `rules.md` first, so the code comes out
  conforming. A rule applied while typing costs nothing; the same rule applied
  afterwards costs an edit, a rebuild, and a test run.
* **After writing or editing any `.java` file**, before reporting the change as
  done, as `AGENTS.md` requires.
* **Whenever asked** to check the coding standard, the conventions, the naming,
  the layout, or the Javadoc.

This skill covers Java only. Markdown files and the prose a reader sees are the
`style-check` skill's, which covers the se-edu Markdown conventions and the
Google developer documentation style guide as well as calling this one.

## Procedure

### 1. Decide what to check

Default to the files changed since the last commit:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD -- '*.java'; git ls-files --others --exclude-standard -- '*.java'
```

If that comes back empty, or the user asked for a full review, check every
tracked Java file instead:

```bash
git ls-files -- '*.java'
```

Say which set you checked. A clean report over one changed file and a clean
report over the whole project are different claims, and the reader has to be
able to tell them apart.

### 2. Mechanical pass

These find *candidates*. Every hit still has to be read against the rule before
it becomes a finding — each pattern over-reports by design, because a check that
misses violations is worse than one that raises a few false alarms. Set
`FILES` to the list from step 1 first.

**Use `grep -P`, never `grep -nE`, for any pattern containing `\s`, `\w`, or
`\b`.** This platform's `grep` does not honor those escapes in an ERE: it reads
`\s` as a literal `s`, so `^\s+public` silently matches nothing and the check
reports clean forever. Three of the patterns below were written with `-E` and
found nothing for exactly that reason. The same trap has an awk half — see the
`switch` check further down.

```bash
grep -nP '\t' $FILES                                    # tabs; indentation is 4 spaces
awk 'length > 110 { print FILENAME":"FNR" ("length" chars)" }' $FILES   # soft 110, hard 120
grep -nP '[ \t]+$' $FILES                               # trailing whitespace
grep -nE 'import .*\*;' $FILES                          # wildcard imports
grep -nP '\b\w+ +\w+ *\[\] *[;=,)]' $FILES              # array specifier on the variable
grep -nP '^\s+public\s+(?!static\s+final\b)[A-Za-z_$][\w<>,\[\]. ]*\s+\w+\s*[;=]' $FILES   # public non-constant fields
grep -nP '\b(if|for|while|switch|catch)\(' $FILES       # missing space after a reserved word
grep -nE '[a-z][A-Z]{2,}' $FILES                        # uppercase acronym inside a name
grep -nP 'void\s+set\w+\s*\(\s*boolean\s+(?!(is|has|was|can|should)[A-Z])\w+' $FILES   # boolean setter form
```

The last one covers the guide's "Setter methods for boolean variables must be of
the form `void setFound(boolean isFound)`", which is a *must* in the guide's own
wording and which the reading pass misses because the method looks ordinary.

A line break placed after an operator rather than before it. The guide says
"Break after a comma. Break before an operator", so a code line ending in `+`,
`.`, `&&`, `||`, or a ternary `?`/`:` is a candidate. Comment lines are excluded
because a sentence ending in a period is not a wrap, and `case`/`default` labels
because a label's trailing colon is not an operator:

```bash
grep -nP '^(?!\s*(\*|//|/\*|case\b|default\b)).*[^&|+*/<>=!:?-]([+*/%]|&&|\|\||\.|\?|:|-)\s*$' $FILES
```

Javadoc block tags, whose descriptions the conventions require to be
punctuated. A description may wrap onto the lines below it and the period
belongs at the end of the last one, which no single-line pattern can see, so
this one is a Gradle task rather than a grep:

```bash
./gradlew checkJavadocTagPunctuation
```

It is wired into `check`, so `./gradlew check` and `./gradlew build` run it too.
Run it directly while editing, because it names every offending line at once
and costs a second.

The blank line the conventions require between a Javadoc description and its
first block tag. Checkstyle's `RequireEmptyLineBeforeBlockTagGroup` covers this
inside the project, so run this one when the skill is pointed at code that the
build does not compile — a classmate's repository, or a pull request under
review. Only the *first* tag is checked, since the line above a later tag is
usually the wrapped tail of the tag before it:

```bash
awk '{ l = $0; gsub(/\r/, "", l) }
     l ~ /\/\*\*/ { inDoc = 1; seenTag = 0; prevText = ""; next }
     inDoc && l ~ /^[ \t]*\*[ \t]*@[a-z]/ {
       if (!seenTag) { seenTag = 1
         if (prevText != "") { print FILENAME":"FNR": no blank line before the tag group" } }
       prevText = "tag"; next }
     inDoc && l ~ /\*\// { inDoc = 0; next }
     inDoc { c = l; sub(/^[ \t]*\*[ \t]?/, "", c); prevText = (c ~ /[^ \t]/) ? c : "" }' $FILES
```

Test method names, which the guide requires to be
`featureUnderTest_testScenario_expectedBehavior`:

```bash
awk '/@Test/ { expectTest = 1; next }
     expectTest && /^\s*(public )?void [A-Za-z0-9_]+\(/ {
       name = $0; sub(/^.*void /, "", name); sub(/\(.*$/, "", name)
       if (name !~ /^[a-z][A-Za-z0-9]*_[A-Za-z0-9]+_[A-Za-z0-9]+$/) print FILENAME":"FNR": "name
       expectTest = 0 }' $FILES
```

A method summary opening with the wrong form of the verb. The guide asks for
`Returns`, not `Return` or `Returning`, so this looks for the bare and the
progressive forms of the verbs this project actually uses:

```bash
grep -nP '^\s*\*\s+(Return|Add|Send|Get|Set|Create|Print|Check|Read|Write|Mark|Say|Tell|Show|Build|Convert|Remove|Keep|Prepare|Start|Open|Move|Color|Give|Finish|Prevent|Refuse|Adding|Returning|Creating|Printing|Reading|Writing|Checking)\b' $FILES
```

Constants, which the guide says should share a common prefix when they are
associated. Which ones are associated is a judgment, so this lists them per
file to be read rather than reporting violations:

```bash
grep -nE 'static final ' $FILES | sed 's/ *=.*//'
```

Indentation inside a `switch`. The guide aligns each `case` with the `switch`
itself and indents only the statements under it, so a `case` sitting one level
in — which is what most IDEs produce — is the violation:

```bash
awk '/switch *\(/ { s = match($0, /[^ ]/) - 1 }
     /^ *case[ (]|^ *default *(:|->)/ { c = match($0, /[^ ]/) - 1
       if (c != s) print FILENAME":"FNR": case at "c", switch at "s }' $FILES
```

Two traps are baked into that pattern, both of which cost a silent pass before.
**Do not write `\b` in an awk regex**: awk reads it as a backspace character,
not a word boundary, so `/^ *(case|default)\b/` matches nothing at all and every
file looks clean. Matching the punctuation that follows the label is what works
here, and it also keeps `default` the interface-method modifier — as in
`default boolean isExit()` — from being read as a `switch` label.

Wrapped lines, which are indented 8 spaces past the line they continue:

```bash
awk '{ i = match($0, /[^ ]/) - 1
       if ($0 ~ /^ *([+.?:]|&&|\|\||[A-Za-z0-9_]+\()/ && prev !~ /[;{}]$/ && prev != "" &&
           prev !~ /^ *(\*|\/\/)/ && i != p + 8 && i != p)
         print FILENAME":"FNR": continuation at "i", parent at "p
       prev = $0; p = i }' $FILES
```

A hit here is often a *nested* wrap — a break inside an argument that is itself
on a wrapped line. Those are legitimate, and the guide's preference for
higher-level breaks is what makes them read correctly.

**Anything in `rules.md` that a pattern can see belongs above, not below.** The
punctuation rule was in `rules.md` from the start and was left to the reading
pass, where it was read past twice and reported clean; a peer reviewer found it
on 156 tags. A rule left to attention is a rule that holds until attention
lapses. So when a check here misses something a person catches, the fix is not
to read more carefully next time — it is to add the check, and to prove it fails
on the case that got through.

**And prove the check itself fails on that case**, before trusting it. A pattern
that is silently inert reports exactly what a passing pattern reports, so a
clean run is only evidence when you have watched the check fire at least once.
Three patterns here — public fields, reserved-word spacing, and the array
specifier — sat inert for their whole life because `grep -nE` does not honor
`\s`, `\w`, or `\b` on this platform, and the `switch` check sat inert because
awk reads `\b` as a backspace. All four reported clean over a repository that
was violating two of them thirteen times. Run a new or edited check against code
you know is bad and confirm the expected line comes out.

### 3. Reading pass

The rules a regex cannot see are the ones worth the most care. Read each file
in scope against `rules.md` and judge:

* **Javadoc.** Does every class and every public method have a header comment?
  Does it open with a sentence that summarizes, in the third person present
  (`Returns`, not `Return` or `Returning`)? Is there a blank line before the
  first `@param`? Is every `@param` present, or none of them? Getters, setters,
  overriding methods whose parent Javadoc still fits, and test methods are
  exempt.
* **Names.** Classes and enums are nouns in PascalCase; methods are verbs in
  camelCase; constants are `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`; booleans read like booleans
  (`isDone`, `hasData`); collections are plural; associated constants share a
  common **prefix**, not a common suffix; acronyms are not shouted
  (`toDvdName`, not `toDVDName`).
* **Test method names.** `featureUnderTest_testScenario_expectedBehavior`.
* **Scope.** Is each variable declared where it is first needed, and
  initialized there? Is any field public that is not a constant?
* **Braces.** Does every `if`, `else`, `for`, and `while` body have them, even
  a one-line one?
* **Blank lines.** Are the logical units within a method separated by one?

### 4. Report

Group findings by file. Give each one the rule it breaks, so the reader can
check the call rather than take it on trust. Separate:

* **Violations** — a stated rule is broken, and the fix is not a matter of
  taste.
* **Judgment calls** — the rule arguably applies, but the current code is
  defensible. Say which way you lean, and leave the decision to the user.

Finish by naming the files checked. If nothing was found, say so plainly; a
clean result is a real result.

## Fixing what you find

Fix violations. Raise judgment calls and leave them alone unless the user
decides. Three cases need care:

* **Anything that changes what the program prints** — an error message, a
  reply, the banner — is covered by `test/ui-test-plan.md`. Update the expected
  output there first, then run the `test-ui` skill, as `AGENTS.md` requires.
* **Renaming anything public** — a class, a method, an enum constant — is a
  design change wearing a style rule's clothes. Propose it; do not do it
  unasked. Renaming a private member is ordinary and needs no permission.
* **Any edit under `src/main/java`** obliges the rest of the `AGENTS.md`
  routine: update the affected JUnit tests, run `./gradlew test`, then run the
  text UI tests.
